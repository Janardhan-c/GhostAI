# GhostAI
This project is a custom-built, lightweight desktop application that acts as a context-aware AI co-pilot by "layering" itself over the user's screen. It is inspired by commercial applications like Cluely, providing real-time information or assistance without disrupting the user's workflow or being visible to others in a virtual environment.
